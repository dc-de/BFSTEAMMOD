It is now ported for STAR WARS™ Battlefront (Classic, 2004) steam version._

**Installation:**

2. Backup files inside the "Star Wars Battlefront (Classic 2004)" folder to an other folder.
3. Unzip the ZIP File and copy the GameData folder inside the "Star Wars Battlefront (Classic 2004)" folder from and overwrite existing files.
